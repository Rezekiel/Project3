      <h1>COURSES</h1>
      <p>This page is dedicated to the courses I am taking this semester and their descriptions according to their syllabus</p>
      <h3>ITMD 421: Data Modeling and Applications</h3>
      <p>Basic data modeling concepts are introduced. Hands-on database design,
implementation, and administration of single-user and shared multi-user
database applications using a contemporary relational database management
system. Prerequisites: None Credit: 2-2-3 Technologies addressed in this course
include SQL and relational database management systems such as the MySQL and
Oracle RDBMS.</p>
      <h3>PS-329: Environmental Politics/Policy</h3>
      <p>The study of politics and policy is traditionally divided among local, national and international
levels. Who gets to make policy, how they make it and how fairly and effectively they
implement it are usually studied as the responsibilities of geographically defined political
processes and institutions. But the global environment challenges those assumptions.
Weather may be local but climate is global. Air, water, flora and fauna respect neither
national borders nor the rules and institutions people create to govern the Earth. While
governments still matter, environmental quality is increasingly impacted by international
organizations, businesses of all types and sizes, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).
Therefore, in this class we attempt two related, complex and challenging tasks:
understand how politics and policy—at multiple levels—affect the ways that human beings
impact their natural environment; and learn how people develop and pursue their interests and
ideas related to the present condition and future of the global environment. </p>
      <h3>ITMD 361: Fall 2018 Fundamentals of Web Development</h3>
      <p>This course will cover the creation of Web pages and sites using HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and graphical applications as well as the client and server architecture of the Internet and related web technologies. The creation and deployment of modern, standards-compliant web pages are addressed. Students create and deploy a Web site with multiple pages and cross-linked structures.</p>
      <h3>ITM 100 Introduction to Information Technology as a Profession</h3>
      <p>Introduces students to concepts of systems, systems theory and modeling,
information systems, and system integration. Examines the steps necessary to analyze a business problem
and identify and define the computing and information requirements appropriate to its solution, with a
focus on how to design, implement, and evaluate a technology-based system to meet desired needs.
Students learn to analyze the local and global impact of computing on individuals, organizations, and
society. Leads students to recognize of the need for continuing professional development, and imparts an
understanding of professional, ethical, legal, security and social issues and responsibilities in information
technology. Students write and present, building their ability to communicate effectively with a range of
audiences, and using standard planning methodologies design an information system to meet the
information needs of a small business.</p>
